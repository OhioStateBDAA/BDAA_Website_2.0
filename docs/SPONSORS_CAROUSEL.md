# Sponsors Carousel Requirements

## Overview
Create a sponsors/partners carousel section that displays company logos in an infinite horizontal scrolling format, positioned between the Hero section and Events section.

## Visual Reference
Based on the wireframe (`Tag Line.png`), the sponsors section should include:
- Horizontal scrolling section with sponsor/partner logos
- Clean, minimal design with logo placeholders
- Seamless infinite scroll animation
- Responsive layout that works on all devices

## Technical Requirements

### Component Structure
- **Location**: Between HeroSection and Events section in main page layout
- **Component Name**: `SponsorsCarousel` or `PartnersCarousel`
- **Directory**: `/src/components/sections/`

### Functionality
1. **Infinite Scroll**: Continuous horizontal movement without visible reset
2. **Auto-play**: Automatic scrolling without user interaction
3. **Hover Pause**: Pause animation on mouse hover
4. **Responsive**: Adapt to different screen sizes
5. **Accessibility**: Proper ARIA labels and keyboard navigation support

### Design System Integration
- Use BDAA color palette from `globals.css`
- Follow existing component patterns and architecture
- Implement using existing layout components (Container, Section)
- Maintain consistent spacing and typography

### Logo Requirements
- Support multiple logo formats (PNG, SVG, JPG)
- Responsive logo sizing
- Placeholder logos during development
- Easy logo addition/removal system
- Proper alt text for accessibility

### Animation Specifications
- **Speed**: Smooth, not too fast or too slow
- **Direction**: Left-to-right horizontal scroll
- **Easing**: Linear for infinite scroll effect
- **Performance**: 60fps smooth animation
- **No Flash**: Seamless loop without visible restart

## Implementation Tasks

### Phase 1: Component Setup
1. Create base SponsorsCarousel component
2. Set up proper TypeScript interfaces
3. Implement basic layout structure
4. Add to main page between Hero and Events

### Phase 2: Carousel Logic
1. Implement infinite scroll animation
2. Add hover pause functionality
3. Ensure smooth looping without gaps
4. Test performance across devices

### Phase 3: Logo Integration
1. Create logo data structure
2. Add placeholder sponsor logos
3. Implement responsive logo sizing
4. Add proper alt text and accessibility

### Phase 4: Styling & Polish
1. Apply BDAA design system
2. Ensure responsive behavior
3. Add proper spacing and alignment
4. Test across all breakpoints

### Phase 5: Optimization
1. Performance optimization
2. Code refactoring for reusability
3. Documentation and comments
4. Final testing and cleanup

## Technical Stack Integration
- **Animation**: CSS animations or Embla Carousel (already in project)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with BDAA design tokens
- **Component**: React Server Component when possible
- **TypeScript**: Full type safety
- **Responsive**: Mobile-first approach

## Success Criteria
- Smooth infinite horizontal scrolling
- No visible animation restarts or glitches
- Works perfectly on mobile and desktop
- Follows BDAA design system consistently
- Accessible to screen readers and keyboard users
- Easy to add/remove sponsors in the future
- Performs well without affecting page load

## Notes
- Consider using existing Embla Carousel library for smooth animations
- Ensure component is easily maintainable for future sponsor additions
- Follow established component architecture patterns
- Implement proper loading states if needed
- Consider lazy loading for logo images
